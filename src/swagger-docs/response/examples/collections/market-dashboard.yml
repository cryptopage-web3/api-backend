Humans are an interplanetary species and have all but abandoned the post-apocalyptic shatters of society on earth. Cats have taken over. One crime-ridden, nondescript inner city is inhabited by a group of cats collectively known as the Gutter Cats. No longer able to rely on the crutch of ‚Äúman‚Äôs best friend‚Äù or live in their nice suburban homes, the Gutter Dogs had to move to the inner city and reinvent themselves as ‚Äútough guys‚Äù. Now, the Dogs spend their days flexing, fighting, and hustling in the streets to make ends meet, trying to figure out a way to make it to the top.",bestSellDate: "2022-06-16T07:24:42.000Z",meta: [{url: "https://gutterspecies.azurewebsites.net/metadata/dogs/2411/image",type: "IMAGE",representation: "ORIGINAL",mimeType: "image/png"}]}],itemsTotal: 41702}
